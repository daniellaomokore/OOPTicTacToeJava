# OOPTicTacToeJava
 
ðŸš€<i>TicTacToe Game built with Java using intermediate Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, data structures and clean code principles.


âœ¨<b>Features:</b>

* OOP
* 2D Arrays
* Abstraction - by using interfaces / abstract classes
* Interface -  A contract that specifies the capabilities that a 'Board' should provide to define the basic behavior of the 'Board'
* Abstract Class - to provide some implementation details for the 'GameBoard'
* Encapsulation - to make sure that sensitive data is hidden from users. -> by declare class attributes as private and using public 'getter' and 'setter' methods to access and update the values of private attributes. 
* Abstraction - reduce complexity by reducing unnecessary details -> by making methods private that handle logic which the user doesn't need to directly use or access e.g 'getCurrentPlayer' .
* Inheritance 
* Polymorphism
* Error Handling
* Modular code
* Constructors and class attributes
* Doc strings

âœ¨How to Play:

* Run `javac Run.java` in the terminal of the root directory of the project or run the 'TicTacToeGame.java' file directly located at -> OOPTicTacToeJava/src/TicTacToe/TicTacToeGame.java
